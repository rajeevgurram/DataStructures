# DataStructures
Implementation of various data structures in Java using object oriented methodologies with unit test cases

TODO:

    //Given a binary tree and a sum, find all the paths that leads to the sum.
    //I had two questions: One was the Djikstra's shortest path algorithm and the second was to find the missing element in the array.
    //How can you sort an array and remove duplicate entries. A few questions on Big O efficiency. Questions on memory management.
    * //Implement a HashMap. Try to stick to the syntax of the language instead of writing pseudo code.
    //Given an array with sorted rows and columns, find the position of given target value in array?
    //Write the object oriented design for a car. Implement its acceleration and deacceleration
    //OOP design, hash maps and hash table related questions, bit manipulation, difference between various data structures and why are they good.
    //Given a stream of words find the most occurring word. Also find the top 100 distinct most occurring words.
    //How does hashing work and its complexity analysis.
    //Algorithm for array re-sizing in average-linear time.
    //Asked Heap related questions (Heapify, Heap-sort).
    //Find the Kth element from the end of a linked list, I'd like to see this done both iteratively and recursively
    //Implement an LRU Cache
    //( Priority Queues) and the ways to implement it.
    //Merge Sort
    //Write a function to find a substring in a string. Test your code, write the test cases.
    //Questions mostly on linked list. Like finding duplicate elements in Singly linked list.
    //You have a list of packages A, B, C such that A is dependent on B,C,D and B is dependent on D and C is dependent on E etc. Print the sequence of packages to run
